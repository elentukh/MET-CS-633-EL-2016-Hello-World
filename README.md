Poem by Anna Akhmatova

     The Muse

(1) All that I am hangs by a thread tonight

(2) as I wait for her whom no one can command.

(3) Whatever I cherish most - youth, freedom, glory -

(4) fades before her who bears the flute in her hand.


(5) And look! she comes ... she tosses back her veil,

(6) staring me down, serene and pitiless.

(7) "Are you the one," I ask, "whom Danter heard dictate

(8) the lines of his Inferno?" She answers: "Yes."

 1924
